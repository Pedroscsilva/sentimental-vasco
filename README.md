I have three folders in my sentiment analysis for my football club project:
One for the scrapper that I used to scrappe the data from supervasco.com, where I collected the commentaries in order to train the model
One for the model, in which after preprocessing the data and realizing multiple tests, I arrived at a fine-tuned SGDClassifier for a 82% accuracy on predicting the sentiment
One for the analysis, in which I do some plots and take the model data for something more human readable.
I would like the readme to expose a bit of everything of the mentioned above, but also to give a good summary of the analysis part, as it is the only thing that will matter for recruiters. So I will give you my main plots and you do the rest :)
